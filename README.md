Fuzzy Chainsaw - MERN Crash Course

Welcome to Fuzzy Chainsaw, a comprehensive crash course for learning the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This project aims to help you get hands-on experience with full-stack JavaScript development.

Project Overview

The MERN stack is a powerful combination of technologies that are used for building full-stack web applications. In this crash course, you will learn how to:

Build backend APIs using Node.js and Express.js.

Connect to and manipulate databases using MongoDB.

Create dynamic and responsive user interfaces using React.

Integrate all these technologies to create a full-stack application.


Technologies Used

MongoDB: NoSQL database used for storing data.

Express.js: Web framework for Node.js to handle HTTP requests and routing.

React: Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Node.js: JavaScript runtime used to build the backend of the application.


Features

Full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

User authentication and authorization.

Responsive design using React components.

Integration of backend API with MongoDB for persistent data storage.

Deployment and environment setup guide for both development and production.


Getting Started

Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js: Download and install Node.js

MongoDB: Download and install MongoDB


You will also need npm (Node Package Manager), which comes with Node.js, for managing project dependencies.

Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/UsmanRizan/fuzzy-chainsaw.git
cd fuzzy-chainsaw


2. Install backend dependencies:

cd backend
npm install


3. Install frontend dependencies:

cd frontend
npm install



Running the Project

1. Start the backend server:

cd backend
npm start

The backend server will run on http://localhost:5000.


2. Start the frontend development server:

cd frontend
npm start

The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000.


3. Open your browser and visit the frontend to interact with the application.



Project Structure

The project is divided into two main folders:

backend: Contains all the server-side code (Node.js + Express).

frontend: Contains the client-side code (React).
